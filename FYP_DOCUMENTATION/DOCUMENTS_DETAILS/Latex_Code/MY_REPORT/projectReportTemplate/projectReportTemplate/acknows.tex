Allah Almighty, who provided me the capability, to finish my final year project as per requirement of BSIT-Degree Program. It was a fresh practice, rousing but inspiring and definitely a great supervision towards market projects. I feel blessed to perform with such a devoted supervisor Mrs. Saima Jawad and supportive teachers for giving me a chance to work on Pet Diet and Healthcare Planner as my final year project and renovating my theoretical knowledge in practical considerate.
